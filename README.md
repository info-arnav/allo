# Allo

Hyperlocal commerce for South Delhi. Get everything you need from neighborhood stores delivered in minutes.

## What We're Building

Allo connects you to the stores already around you — not through dark stores or ghost kitchens, but through real shops in your neighborhood. The kirana down the street, the local pharmacy around the corner, the neighborhood snack shop you pass every day. Real businesses, real people, real fresh produce.

These kiranas already serve you. They know the area. They stock what you need. We just make them accessible on WhatsApp.

Right now it's simple: message us what you need, we check with nearby stores, confirm the price, and deliver it to you fast. Usually under 30 minutes.

### Current Coverage

- Hauz Khas
- Greater Kailash (GK)
- Defence Colony
- Panchsheel
- Saket

## How It Works (POC Phase)

We're running the POC entirely on WhatsApp to validate the model and understand what people actually order.

1. **You send a message** — text or photo of what you need
2. **We check availability** — with partner stores in your area
3. **We confirm** — send you the price
4. **We deliver** — usually within 30 minutes

This lets us learn the real patterns: what people order, which stores respond reliably, delivery timing, costs, repeat behavior, and which categories make sense to scale.

## Why This Matters

Most quick commerce relies on dark stores — warehouses pretending to be shops, disconnected from the neighborhood. We think that's backwards.

Your area already has stores. They already stock what you need. They're already part of the community. We just make them digitally accessible.

No app installs. No new accounts. Just WhatsApp.

## The Vision

Start with groceries and essentials. Expand to everything in your neighborhood.

Eventually: order anything from local stores — fresh food, fashion, cosmetics, electronics, home goods — all from shops that already exist near you. No reason to go to the mall unless you want to.

We're building infrastructure that makes every store in your city one message away.
